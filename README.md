Interactive Textile Image Gallery

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project allows users to search through over 300 images of globally-sourced textiles documented on Dutch ships during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Users can select a number of inputs to further refine their search. Additionally, when an image of interest is clicked on, information regarding the selected textile is displayed to provide the user with a deeper understanding of the history of the object itself.
